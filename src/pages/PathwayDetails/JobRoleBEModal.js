          A <strong>back-end developer</strong> is a software engineer who
          focuses on the development of the server-side components of a software
          application. 
          <br />
          <br />
          They are responsible for designing and building the part
          of the software that runs on the server and is responsible for
          processing data and serving it to the front-end components of the
          application. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Back-end developers use a variety of technologies to
          build server-side components, including programming languages such as
          Java, Python, or Ruby, and database technologies such as SQL or NoSQL.
          They must have a strong understanding of data structures, algorithms,
          and system architecture, as well as good problem-solving skills.
