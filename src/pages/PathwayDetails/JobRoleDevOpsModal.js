          A <strong>DevOps engineer</strong> is a professional responsible for
          the collaboration between software development and IT operations
          teams. They work to streamline the software development lifecycle
          (SDLC) through the integration of development, testing, deployment,
          and operations.
          <br />
          <br />
          The goal is to automate and optimize processes, improving software
          quality and reducing time to market. DevOps engineers typically have a
          background in software development, system administration, or network
          engineering. They work closely with developers, quality assurance (QA)
          teams, and operations personnel to create and maintain automated
          processes and tools.
          <br />
          <br />
          They also ensure that the production environment is stable, secure,
          and scalable. DevOps engineers often use a variety of tools and
          technologies such as containerization platforms, cloud services,
          configuration management tools, continuous integration/continuous
          delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, and monitoring tools to achieve their
          goals. They are also responsible for monitoring and analyzing system
          metrics to identify and resolve issues before they impact the
          end-users.
